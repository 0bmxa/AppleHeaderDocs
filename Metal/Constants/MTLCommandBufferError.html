<p>Error codes that can be found in <a href="../Protocols/MTLCommandBuffer.html">MTLCommandBuffer</a>.error</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorInternal
An internal error that doesn&rsquo;t fit into the other categories. The actual low level error code is encoded in the local description.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorTimeout
Execution of this command buffer took too long, execution of this command was interrupted and aborted.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorPageFault
Execution of this command buffer generated an unserviceable GPU page fault. This can caused by buffer read write attribute mismatch or out of boundary access.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorBlacklisted
Access to this device has been revoked because this client has been responsible for too many timeouts or hangs.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorNotPermitted
This process does not have access to use this device.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorOutOfMemory
Insufficient memory was available to execute this command buffer.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorInvalidResource
The command buffer referenced an invalid resource.  This is most commonly caused when the caller deletes a resource before executing a command buffer that refers to it.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorMemoryless
One or more internal resources limits reached that prevent using memoryless render pass attachments. See error string for more detail.</p>

<p>@constant MTLCommandBufferErrorDeviceRemoved
The device was physically removed before the command could finish execution</p>
